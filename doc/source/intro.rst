Introduction
============

BASE OAI-PMH Validity Checker (OVAL) is a tool for
checking document servers' compatibilty to the 
harvester and indexer of Bielefeld Academic Search
Engine (BASE). This involves mainly the validation of
compliance with the Open Archives Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting (OAI-PMH). However, OVAL also performs
some content-related tests normally not covered by
OAI-PMH validators.

    The web application front-end is developed separately in
    a project named *ovalserver*.
